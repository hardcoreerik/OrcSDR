# FT8 Native Decoder Changelog

This file tracks changes made specifically by the native OrcSDR FT8 decoder workstream. The main branch did not contain a repository-wide CHANGELOG.md when this workstream started.

## 2026-10-07 — Phase 0 research

- Created the native FT8 decoder research branch from current OrcSDR main.
- Added DECODER_RESEARCH.md covering the current FT8 protocol, existing decoder strategies, embedded constraints, ESP32-P4/Tab5 capabilities, clean-room provenance, proposed OrcSDR architecture, risks, and benchmark plan.
- Recorded that the DecoderBackend and Decode UI seam is currently on the separate FT8 UI sandbox branch rather than main; no UI work was copied into this branch.
- Established a Phase 0 stop gate: no decoder implementation begins until the owner approves the research decisions.
- No firmware/runtime code, transmit code, DSP changes, or hardware-validation claims were added.


## 2026-10-07 — Phase 1 slice 1: protocol primitives

- Owner approved the Phase 0 workflow; implementation remains confined to `codex/ft8-native-decoder-research` and draft PR #172.
- Added a pure C++17 FT8 protocol core with no ESP-IDF dependencies: protocol sizes, CRC-14, standard callsign c28 encoding, 10/12/22-bit callsign hashes, FT8 Gray tone mapping, and Costas/data-symbol framing.
- Added host regression runners for Linux/WSL and PowerShell plus optimized and ASan/UBSan coverage.
- Cross-checked the independent implementation against the QEX authors' explicitly public-domain helper resources: 100 CRC vectors, 100 callsign-hash vectors, and 100 standard-callsign encodings; 300/300 matched.
- Added `docs/ft8/PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` as the implementation/provenance notebook.
- This slice is not wired into the Tab5 firmware build, changes no receiver DSP, adds no transmit path, and makes no hardware-verification claim.
